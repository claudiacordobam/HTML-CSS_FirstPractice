# HTML and CSS: First Practice
This repository contains the first page I created as part of the HTML and CSS subject of the Bachelor's Degree in Multimedia. This subject took place during the Spring semester of the scholar year 2023-2024.
The prompt for this exercise required the students to replicate a webpage from a screenshot we were provided with. The languages that had to be used were HTML and CSS.
This was the first practice that we had to develop using HTML and CSS and, therefore, it does not have a high level of complexity (language-wise).
