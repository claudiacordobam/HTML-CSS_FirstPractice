            has come a long way since its inception in the late 1990s. What
            started as a simple styling language has evolved into a robust
            toolset for creating immersive web experiences. As technology
            advances and web standards evolve,
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets" class="paragraph-abbr"
              >CSS</abbr

            continues to adapt and improve.
          </p>
          <p>
            The advent of responsive web design (<abbr

              class="paragraph-abbr"
              >RWD</abbr

            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets" class="paragraph-abbr"
              >CSS</abbr
            >. No longer confined to fixed-width layouts, designers now embrace
            fluid grids and flexible media queries to ensure optimal viewing
            experiences across devices.

            <abbr title="Leaner Style Sheets" class="paragraph-abbr">Less</abbr>
            have streamlined the development process, allowing for modular,
            maintainable stylesheets. These tools empower developers to write
            cleaner, more efficient code and iterate quickly on design
            iterations.
